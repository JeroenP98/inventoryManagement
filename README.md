## About

The Inventory Management System is a software application designed to help businesses manage their inventory of products, supplies, and materials. The system allows users to track the movement of goods from suppliers to warehouses to sales channels, and monitor inventory levels in real-time.

The main features of the Inventory Management System include:

* **Inventory tracking:** The system allows users to track and quantity of each item in their inventory, as well as its current status (e.g., in stock, out of stock, on order, etc.).
* **Order management:** The system enables users to create and manage purchase and sales orders
* **Reporting and analytics:** The system provides users with various reports and analytics on inventory levels, sales, orders, and other key performance indicators.
* **User handling logging:** The system logs all user activity, including login/logout, changes to inventory or customer data, and any other actions performed by users.
* **Relations/Customer database:** The system allows users to create and maintain a database of customers or relations, including contact information, order history, and other relevant details. This allows users to easily track customer orders and interactions, and provides insights into customer behavior and preferences

The Inventory Management System is designed for businesses from a startup to small size

> By using the Inventory Management System, businesses can improve their supply chain management, reduce stockouts and overstocking, increase efficiency and accuracy, and ultimately, boost their bottom line.
